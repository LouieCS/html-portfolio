<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>
    I love eating food... is that a hobby? Okay, fine... I "enjoy" working out so I can eat food. Sports are pretty cool. I'm a huge hockey fan (Let's Go Sharks!) and I also watch football when my San Jose Sharks aren't playing. Bang bang Niner gang! The Golden State Warriors are my basketball team; Giants, baseball. We have many cool hiking and mountain biking trails here in the San Francisco Bay Area. Hiking and mountain biking are fun, but I just really hate going downhill. Last but not least, my favorite hobby is whatever as long as I get to spend time with my loved ones.
