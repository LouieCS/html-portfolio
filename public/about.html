<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, World! My name is Louie, a recent B.S. Computer Science graduate from Western Governors University. I am highly self-motivated, resilient, and thrive as a team player. Before pursuing my CompSci degree, I worked as a nursing assistant in the healthcare industry. This experience taught me valuable skills such as excellent teamwork, effective communication, strong organizational skills, attention to detail, and a solid work ethic. I am confident that these skills will serve me well in tech. I have a strong foundation in software development principles and exposure to languages such as Java, Python, C++, SQL (MySQL & PostgreSQL), AIML, HTML, and CSS. I enjoy being a lifelong learner, acquiring new skills to broaden my knowledge base.</p>
